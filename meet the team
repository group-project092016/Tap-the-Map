Hi, my name is Leonard Leong. I've always had an interest for creating useful applications. I enjoy working in groups, as it is interesting to see the greater things people can accomplish collectively. For the application, I will help with the user interface and features. I will also help with constantly assessing our next steps, logging our progress and ensuring our goals are met within deadlines.
Hey, I am Joseph Lopez. I have some experience with android development, as well as some backend programming with C/C++. Since this project will be ios based, I look forward to tackling a new language, and the challenges that go with it. I am expecting to be involved with some API integration, some GUI, as well as some other backend tasks.
Hi, my name is Riyesh Nath. I have enjoyed working on backend and have experience with working on both Relational Database (MYSQL) and NoSQL (BigData: MongoDB, Spark, Neo4j). I have worked on Android application as well. Although I would like to focus on back-end and database specific task, I can partially work on some front-end as well. I am willing to learn and work on new challenges that we will face as a team on our project.
