Hi, my name is Alan Lau. Our project is an application for ios. I am knowledgable in application development and usage of API. I will help with the GUI and coding of the app.
Hi, my name is Leonard Leong. I've always had an interest for creating useful applications. I enjoy working in groups, as it is interesting to see the greater things people can accomplish collectively. For the application, I will help with the user interface and features. I will also help with constantly assessing our next steps, logging our progress and ensuring our goals are met within deadlines.
